# R syntax
# Assignment operator
#In RStudio, typing Alt + - (push Alt at the same time as the - key, on Mac     type option + -) will write ` <- ` in a single keystroke.
x <- 3
y <- 5
# to display variable value in console
y
x
# you can now add the variable
x+y
# assign a new variable
number <- x+y
# Try changing the value of the variable x to 5. What happens to number? 
# it changes
x <- 5
# Now try changing the value of variable y to contain the value 10. What do you need to do, to update the variable number?
# rerun the variable assignment code ```number <- x+y```
y <- 10
number <- x+y
