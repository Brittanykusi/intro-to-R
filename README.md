#### what is R?
 - an environment for statistical computing and graphics, which brings together a number of features to provide powerfulfunctionality.       
#### Why use R?
- visualization
- Data Science
- Open Source
- Platform agnostic
- Computations statistics       
    - example
    “R package of data and code behind the stories and interactives at FiveThirtyEight.com, a data-driven journalism website founded by Nate Silver (initially began as a polling aggregation site, but now covers politics, sports, science and pop culture) and owned by ESPN…” - fivethirtyeight Package
#### What is RStudio?
RStudio is freely available open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE). RStudio provides an environment with many features to make using R easier and is a great alternative to working on R in the terminal.
- has 4 main panels
    - Console: where you can type commands and see output. The console is all you would see if you ran R in the command line without RStudio.
    - Script editor: where you can type out commands and save to file. You can also submit the commands to run in the console.
    - Environment/History: environment shows all active objects and history keeps track of all commands run in console
    - Files/Plots/Packages/Help
- If you wanted to choose a different directory to be your working directory, you could navigate to a different folder in the Files tab, then, click on the More dropdown menu and select Set As Working Directory.
- If R is still waiting for you to enter more data because it isn’t complete yet, the console will show a ```+ ```prompt. It means that you haven’t finished entering a complete command. Often this can be due to you having not ‘closed’ a parenthesis or quotation.
- If you’re in Rstudio and you can’t figure out why your command isn’t running, you can click inside the console window and press esc to escape the command and bring back a new prompt >.
#### Creating a new project directory on RStudio
1. Open RStudio application
2. Click on ```file``` and select ``` New Project ```
3. In the ```New Project window```, choose New Directory. Then, choose ```New Project```. Name your new directory ```Intro-to-R``` and then “Create the project as subdirectory of:” the Desktop (or location of your choice).
4. Click on ```Create Project ```
5. After your project is completed, if the project does not automatically open in RStudio, then go to the ```File``` menu, select Open Project, and choose ```Intro-to-R.Rproj```.
6. When RStudio opens, you will see three panels in the window.
7. Go to the ```File``` menu and select ```New File```, and select ```R Script```. The RStudio interface should now look like the screenshot below.
#### R syntax
- the comments # and how they are used to document function and its content
- variables and functions
- the assignment operator <-
    - ex: x <-3
- the = for arguments in functions
